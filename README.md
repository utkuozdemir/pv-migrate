`pv-migrate` is a CLI tool/kubectl plugin to easily migrate 
the contents of one Kubernetes `PersistentVolumeClaim` to another.

> [!WARNING]
> I get that it can be frustrating not to hear back about the stuff you've brought up or the changes you've suggested. But honestly, for over a year now, I've hardly had any time to keep up with my personal open-source projects, including this one. I am still committed to keep this tool working and slowly move it forward, but please bear with me if I can't tackle your fixes or check out your code for a while. Thanks for your understanding.

## Introduction

On Kubernetes, if you need to rename a resource (like a `Deployment`) or to move it to a different namespace, 
you can simply create a copy of its manifest with the new namespace and/or name and apply it.

However, it is not as simple with `PersistentVolumeClaim` resources: They are not only metadata,
but they also store data in the underlying storage backend.

In these cases, moving the data stored in the PVC can become a problem, making migrations more difficult.

## Use Cases

:arrow_right: You have a database that has a PersistentVolumeClaim `db-data` of size `50Gi`.  
Your DB grew over time, and you need more space for it.  
You cannot resize the PVC because it doesn't support [volume expansion](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/12/resizing-persistent-volumes-using-kubernetes/).  
Simply create a new, bigger PVC `db-data-v2` and use `pv-migrate` to copy data from `db-data` to `db-data-v2`.


:arrow_right: You need to move PersistentVolumeClaim `my-pvc`  from namespace `ns-a` to namespace `ns-b`.  
Simply create the PVC with the same name and manifest in `ns-b` and use `pv-migrate` to copy its content.


:arrow_right: You are moving from one cloud provider to another, 
and you need to move the data from one Kubernetes cluster to the other.  
Just use `pv-migrate` to copy the data **securely over the internet**.

:arrow_right: You need to change the `StorageClass` of a volume, for instance,
from a `ReadWriteOnce` one like `local-path`) to a `ReadWriteMany` like NFS.
As the `storageClass` is not editable, you can use `pv-migrate` to transfer
the data from the old PVC to the new one with the desired StorageClass.

## Highlights

- Supports in-namespace, in-cluster as well as cross-cluster migrations
- Uses rsync over SSH with a freshly generated [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) 
  or RSA keys each time to securely migrate the files
- Allows full customization of the manifests (e.g. specifying your own docker images for rsync and sshd, configuring affinity etc.)
- Supports multiple migration strategies to do the migration efficiently and fallback to other strategies when needed:
  - Mount both PVCs in a single pod (mnt2)
  - ClusterIP service (svc)
  - LoadBalancer service (lbsvc)
  - NodePort service (nodeport)
  - Local port-forward transfer (local)
- Customizable strategy order
- Supports arm32v7 (Raspberry Pi etc.) and arm64 architectures as well as amd64
- Supports completion for popular shells: bash, zsh, fish, powershell

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for various installation methods and shell completion configuration.

## Usage

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for the CLI reference and examples.
